# Cassava leaf disease classification
[![PyPI version shields.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/pypi-0.0.2-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/cassava-classifier/)
[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/cassava-classifier)](https://pepy.tech/project/cassava-classifier)
The idea of this project is to build a Classifier Model to find the leaf disease type and it has almost 5 class and a im-balanced Class

## Installation
`pip install cassava-classifier`





## Example inference

```python
import PIL import Image
from cassava.pretrained import get_model

image = Image.open("<insert your image path here>")

# Use cassava.list_models() to see list of all available pretrained models with metrics
model = get_model(name:str)
model.predict_as_json(image: np.array)
>> [{"class_name":str, "confidence": float}]

```
# Our Pipeline
    1.Model Architecture - Efficeientnet-B4 , Noisy Weights
    2.Image Size         - 512
    3.Optimizer          - Adam
    4.Scheduler          - GradualWarumUpScheduler
    5.Loss               - Focal Cosine Loss
    6.Augmentations      - Hard Augmentations
    7.Epochs             - 10
    8.Early Stopping     - No
    9.Mixed Precision    - Yes
