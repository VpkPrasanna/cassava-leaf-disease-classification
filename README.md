# Cassava leaf disease classification

The idea of this competition is to build a Classifier Model to find the leaf disease type and it has almost 5 class and a im-balanced Class

## Installation

```python
pip install cassava
```





## Example inference

```python
import cv2
from cassava.pretrained import get_model

image = cv2.imread("<insert your image path here>")

# Use cassava.list_models() to see list of all available pretrained models with metrics
model = cassava.get_model("")
model.predict(image: np.array)
>> [{"image_id":str, "class": int,"probability": float}]

model.predict(images: list)
>> [{"image_id":str, "class": int,"probability": float},
>>  {"image_id":str, "class": int,"probability": float},
>>  ...]
```
